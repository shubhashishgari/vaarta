## What is Vaarta?

Vaarta is a real-time voice translation system for India's public infrastructure. Two people who don't share a language open one app, place a phone between them, speak naturally, and understand each other instantly.

**No buttons. No setup. No manual language selection.** The app disappears. The conversation remains.

### Target Environments
Hospitals, police stations, public transport, government offices.

### Target Users
Migrants, patients, tourists, non-local citizens — people who need translation most.

---

## Supported Languages

Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, English.

**110 bidirectional translation pairs** with Hindi as pivot fallback.

## Architecture

```
Microphone Input
       ↓
  stt.py — transcribe audio, detect language, detect gender
       ↓
  clarify.py — check confidence, domain keywords, surface clarification
       ↓
  translate.py — apply personal vocab, preserve English words, translate
       ↓
  tts.py — generate speech with gender-matched voice
       ↓
  Speaker hears translated output
```

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3.13, FastAPI + Uvicorn |
| Speech-to-Text | faster-whisper (small, CPU, int8) |
| Translation | deep-translator (Google) |
| Text-to-Speech | ElevenLabs (eleven_multilingual_v2) + gTTS fallback |
| Gender Detection | librosa pitch analysis (165 Hz threshold) |
| Frontend | Flutter (Android) |
| Real-time | WebSocket |

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd vaarta
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env`:
```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Start the server:
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

Server runs at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

On the connection screen, enter your server's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.x:8000`).
